Security Deals with playing major role in todayâ€™s life. Here we have made use of
RFID and keypad technology. The RFID is initially provided the authorized
address and the password is set for the keypad module. If the person is authorized
then the RFID passes the access to the keypad to ensure the second security level
and if the person is unauthorized the RFID goes to the false/ fail state and
indicates the unauthenticated access by buzzer beep. This system can be
implemented in places where security is major requirement like house, bank,
offices, etc. In every sector security plays major role and the aim of this project
is to provide the required level of security with low cost. The implementation of
this security system is limited to the automation of the door automation in home
automation. This system is controlled by Arduino At Mega 2560. The
microcontroller detects the output of the RFID, 3X4 Keypad. The response given
by the microcontroller will be controlled by the buzzer.
